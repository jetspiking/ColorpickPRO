If you enjoy this software series, you could consider supporting me by purchasing application [Colorpick - PRO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388790/Colorpick__PRO). For a few dollars (depending on Steam pricing in region) you receive a DRM-free Colorpick application. You can also contact me through mail if you would like the to purchase the application outside Steam (from https://colorpick.nl).
